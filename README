# How to launch Gnosis Chain node with Docker Compose, Nethermind, Haproxy, Letsencrypt and Certbot

This project will automate the node creation with ansible

1. Clone this repo:

    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/smariko/nethermind_gnosis
    $ cd nethermind_gnosis
    # Adjust the inventory to your environment
    $ ansible-playbook -vvv -i inventory/hosts -l [LIMIT] playbook.yml
    ```

After docker containers are created, the node will sync with the chain (may take a while).
